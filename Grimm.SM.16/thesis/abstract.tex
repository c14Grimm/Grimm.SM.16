The research presented in this paper details a new algorithm for solving continuous time pursuit-evasion problems.
The algorithm, called Best Response Tensor-Based Value Iteration builds on concepts from game theory, dynamic programming, and tensor-train decomposition.
Besides Best Response Tensor-Based Value Iteration, various methods for solving pursuit-evasion games are explored including $\textnormal{RRT}^*$.
This work culminates in the development of the Best Response Tensor-Based Value Iteration as well as its application to two different pursuit-evasion problems. The use of Best Response Tensor-Based Value Iteration greatly reduces the time required to solve these problems while only permitting a modest reduction in solution accuracy.
