The research presented in this paper details a new algorithm for solving high dimensional pursuit-evasion problems, called Best-Response Tensor-Train-decomposition-based Value Iteration(BR-TT-VI). This algorithm builds on concepts from game theory, dynamic programming(DP), and tensor-train (TT) decomposition.
Various other methods used to solve pursuit-evasion games are often plagued with unreasonable computational times when the problem involves a state space that is defined by an excessive number of variables. This problem, called the curse of dimensionality, can be mitigated under certain circumstances by utilizing tensor-train decomposition.
This work culminates in the development of the BR-TT-VI algorithm as well as its application to two different pursuit-evasion problems. First, a four-dimensional problem capable of being solved by traditional value iteration(VI) is tackled by the BR-TT-VI algorithm. This problem allows a direct comparison between VI and BR-TT-VI to demonstrate the reduced computational time of the new algorithm. Finally, BR-TT-VI is used to solve a six-dimensional problem that is impractical to solve with VI. The results of these examples demonstrate that BR-TT-VI can greatly reduce the computational time of solving problems while only permitting a modest reduction in solution accuracy.
